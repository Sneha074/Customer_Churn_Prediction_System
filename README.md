# Customer_Churn_Prediction_System

# S – Situation

Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, especially those operating on a subscription-based model. High churn rates indicate that customers are leaving, impacting revenue and long-term growth. The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn data to identify key factors influencing customer retention and suggest data-driven strategies for improvement.

# T – Task

The goal of the project is to analyze customer data, identify patterns in churn behavior, and create insights using data visualization and statistical analysis. The specific objectives include:

* Cleaning and preprocessing customer data.
* Identifying correlations between churn and factors like contract type, payment methods, tenure, and monthly charges.
* Creating visual insights using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Pandas.
* Developing potential strategies for customer retention.

# A – Action

1. Data Import & Exploration:

* Loaded the dataset (customer_churn.csv) using Pandas.
* Displayed a random sample of data to understand the structure.
* Dropped unnecessary columns (e.g., customerID) to simplify analysis.
* Checked data types and handled numerical inconsistencies.

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

* Converted non-numeric values where necessary.
* Handled missing or incorrect values.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Used Matplotlib and Pandas to visualize relationships.
* Plotted histograms, bar charts, and correlation heatmaps to identify significant features influencing churn.

4. Insights & Interpretation:

* Identified key factors contributing to customer churn, such as contract duration, service type, and payment method.
* Suggested retention strategies based on findings.

# R – Result

* Successfully identified major factors influencing customer churn.
* Visualized trends and patterns to support decision-making.
* Provided actionable insights, such as offering long-term contracts and discounts to reduce churn rates.
